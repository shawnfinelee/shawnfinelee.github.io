## 关于博客

> 我希望通过共享知识能够和更多的人交流，大多数时候，这个站点主要是以分享一些见闻，知识，技术，心得，趣闻，等等，反正是个大杂烩，对于文章的内容，质量，风格基本上没有什么要求，主要是在一种轻松的氛围下享受编程和技术其中的点点滴滴就可以了。（来自酷壳）


> Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college, but it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever--because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference. (from Steve Jobs)
